## Vision

Speech-AI training data is drastically scarcer than text. **OTO** pairs a wearable voice-capture device with a smartphone app to turn daily conversations into structured data. For major languages: personalized services. For under-represented languages: monetization through data licensing. We're building a speech-based Google Trends with DePIN-style token incentives.

## Architecture

```
oto_ios_testflight/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/           # Mobile app for voice capture & analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ contract/          # Smart contracts for USDC rewards
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This overview
```

## Value Propositions

- **Users**: Personalized AI services or data monetization
- **AI Development**: High-quality, diverse voice training data
- **Ecosystem**: Decentralized infrastructure with token incentives

## Tech Stack

- **Mobile**: React Native + Expo
- **Blockchain**: Solidity on Base network
- **AI**: Real-time conversation analysis & transcription

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd oto_ios_testflight

# Mobile app
cd frontend && npm install && npm run ios

# Smart contracts
cd contract && bun install && bun run compile
```
